04/25/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,331XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/25/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3222896

Further some credits that he found were not credited to the amount of {$6800.00}. He emailed us that this amount should be credited but this was never issued by Amex. Interest on these have been continuing for the past ten years. We have sent dozens and dozens of emails, phone calls and reminders to their executive and consumer complaint team hoping they would take ownership of their errors and accept the emails of their former employees. In the interim the account was on auto-pay and they were charging us monthly interest of over 30 %. 
The reason we couldnt stop this minimum atuo-pay is because they would report nonpayment to the credit agencies, and they would ruin Mr. XXXX credit. 
I just reached out to Amexs executive team again to request to resolve this, and they found uncredited fraud charges for {$1000.00}, however, the interest rates charged on balances were approximately 30 % and the credits issued were calculated at a nominal interest rate. Approximately {$47000.00} has been paid in interest only till date on these uncredited disputes and fraud charges which despite immense patience and several emails to Amex has not be credited. 
Attached are emails to the account representatives.

04/25/19,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"We are raising a new concern regarding debt collection practices our recent filing on the following : We originally opened an account with XXXX XXXX via their third party creditor - XXXX XXXX XXXX - who has taken advantage of us as consumers, U.S. Veterans, and XXXX XXXX Minorities. We previously reported and wrote a letter in XX/XX/XXXX that we were experiencing extenuating medical and financial circumstances, due to our daughter being hospitalized for over 34 Days in XXXX and my major job loss and made many attempts inXX/XX/XXXX with calling in to request special exceptions and special programs due to these difficult challenges we were having and my husband had already given XXXX the permission to speak with me, XXXX XXXX, ( his wife ), which is documented and taped on XXXX recording systems as well. They made no attempt to provide us with a special finance program due to the extenuating financial & medical circumstances we expressed and have be exasperated mentally and physically over the last 2 years with caring for our daughters major illness and life-threatening medical condition she encountered at the end of XX/XX/XXXX while away at school. We encountered over {$70000.00} in medical bills and had to care for our daughter. Although we made concerted efforts to notify XXXX and request a special exception/program, they showed no empathy nor sympathy concerning our situation and we were not given any notice until someone knocked on our door regarding lawsuit paperwork which were unaware. We also did not receive the proper notification that it was being turned over to a lawyer or the written prior indication that a lawsuit was imminent via a document called a Notice of Intent to Sue. Upon receiving the falsified lawsuit, I again made multiple calls to XXXX starting in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX &XX/XX/XXXX& XX/XX/XXXX, in an attempt to discuss the account, the letter they received in XX/XX/XXXX, and potential workout plans but was never given the opportunity avail. I explained that I sent letter explaining our situation in XX/XX/XXXX when our daughter was hospitalized for 34 Days Including XXXX  and never received a response on workout plan. I also spoke to Ms. XXXX, the Assigned Account Manager, in XX/XX/XXXX who stated she would escalate the request to her management team to reduce the balance and see what type of settlement offer they could provide. However, I never heard back. I made other attempts over 10 to call back in to pick up the conversation which was had in XX/XX/XXXX and was promised they would get back with me but never did and calls were recorded on their systems if they did not delete them. I also reached out to contact XXXX again in XX/XX/XXXX, & XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with another Account Manager,  XXXX, after being directed to the shark Day Law firm whom they hired and who also utilized stall tactics, claiming they reached out to XXXX regarding our multiple requests to negotiate the balance he was attempting to collect on a {$2000.00} card with costs inflated to {$4000.00}. XXXX claimed she was also going to get with her manager to request an exception to negotiate the balance and promised to circle back to me on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, since I made attempts to contact the lawyer via phone and they were screening and dodging my calls. However, I never heard back from XXXX and attempted to call back in on XXXX XXXX and received various transfers to different people which was another run around stall tactic. I also made several attempts to contact The Day Law Firm to speak with XXXX the assigned law representative the The Day Law Firm and on almost every instant between XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, she avoided my calls and would not pick up the phone. I also had to dial another extensionXXXX, to get someone else to pick up and reach XXXX so I could discuss the account and try to negotiate, after they also received an email per their instruction from my husband to grant me permission to speak on the account. Also, we were originally inquiring with a lawyer via XXXX XXXX to attempt to send a negotiation letter on the account, however, that was denied as well. We did not retain the lawyer and was subsequently told that we now needed to send a letter of release from XXXX XXXX XXXX, but we never retained them. These were also other illegal forms of stall tactics utilized by the Day Law Firm which was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX to come after us, although we made several attempts to notify XXXX of our situation and request a Workout Plan but was denied or lied to on every count. Also, with other attempts to reach Day Law Firm via email and voicemail messages, I asked if they had reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and they claimed they were waiting to hear back. However, when I reached out to XXXX on the late afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX, she informed me that they had no indication on file or anywhere in the system that the Day Law Firm reached out to them, since we proposed negotiations on XXXX XXXX. I also left a voice mail to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  regarding their stall tactics, since I did not receive an answer from XXXX nor did I receive a return call on any of the messages I left with Day Law Firm. They were also taking advantage of us during this time because they knew an Answer had to be filed by XX/XX/XXXX or else it would Default to a Judgement which were trying to avoid. And widen I did finally get XXXX on the phone after her colleague went to her desk on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told we did not have to file an Answer by XXXX at Day Law Firm as she claimed, we are waiting to hear back from the client and most people don't file an answer and I said I wanted to be certain that they would not try to default and she said no that wont happen. However after, the call she never picked back up each time I called in and I, in turn, called XXXX again, and spoke to XXXX who claimed she did not know what filing an Answer was, although she was in the Legal department and also wanted to verify where my husband worked when I called in on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, although this had never been discussed previously. Each party, XXXX and The Day Law firm were corroborating against us and not willing to help us and attempting to take advantage of us in the process. Also the account is under {$3000.00}, however, the Day Law Firm, on purpose and with ill will intent filed the claim in State of Georgia Civil Court vs. the Magistrate XXXX County Court which oversees civil claims under $ 25K only to take advantage of XXXX Minorities in attempt to take their payroll checks in hopes of one not filing an Answer or making it difficult on the defendant. Therefore, we also believe we are being discriminated and retaliated against as U.S. Military Veterans and XXXX XXXX XXXX Minorities which I stated to Day Law Firm as well via email phone call on XX/XX/XXXX& XX/XX/XXXX due to stall tactics lack of empathy, and on purpose telling us lies between XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXXand taking advantage of us in a vulnerable state as XXXX XXXX XXXX Minorities and U. S. Military Veterans. 

We are requesting that XXXX work with us on the real balance of the account which is {$2300.00} and discuss letter and request for workout plan, prior to our account being transferred to The Day Law Firm in XXXX, GA who takes advantage of XXXX XXXX XXXX Minorities in the GA. I was informed by a XXXX the balance was {$2300.00} prior to in being transferred to Day Law Firm and had to ask for the Account details, but was not provided this information by XXXX when I called in XX/XX/XXXX, although they had access to it but was told they could not retrieve and had to go through the Day Law Firm. I kept getting the run around regarding this request as well and after requesting it repeatedly in email and phone with Day Law Firm, they did not send it until XX/XX/XXXX, the last day to file an Answer.

06/23/19,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Problems at the end of the loan or lease,Problem with paying off the loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX I signed a car loan agreement to finance my 2008 XXXX XXXX XXXX   car. 
The loan amount was {$5400.00}, that is the amount that was financed. The interest was 8.54 %. The total amount to be paid back was {$6500.00}, in 48 months payments. The amount per month was {$130.00}. The payments began on XX/XX/XXXX and were to end on XX/XX/XXXX. Fortunately I made some payments that were much more than the monthly required amount of {$130.00}. That means that the final payment is now to be well before XX/XX/XXXX. In fact I did my last payment in XX/XX/XXXX. In addition I have mailed them a final payment of {$180.00} ( {$50.00} deferral fee and {$130.00} for the payment I skipped XX/XX/XXXX ). 
During the term of loan I received no communication, no monthly account statement and no notice of late payments. Also I have been making my payment on time every month with the exception of the skipped payment in XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have called the bank to let them know I moved from the address that was on the loan agreement. Then called the bank again to let them know I had moved out of state. Then a year later when I moved again to a different address. All 3 times I gave them my new address and the individuals I spoke with each time, stated to me that the address was updated. 
According to the instructions in the payment book provided to me at the beginning of the loan it is stated that "" we will send you a statement for your final payment amount in advance of your due date ''. The due date is the XXXX of each month and installment payment is considered late after the XXXX ( XXXX ) of the month. When I had not received any statement, letter or even phone call by XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the bank and was told they would send the invoice after reviewing my account. I contacted them again in XX/XX/XXXX regarding any balance that was still outstanding and was told the same thing. Then with no response from the bank I sent them a certified letter in XX/XX/XXXX including the skipped payment of {$180.00} ( as stated above ). That certified letter was returned to me marked "" address unknown ''. This was because no one would sign for it as requested by me. It was then I resent it out to the same address as regular mail. Only then did they receive it, along with the payment. It was after receiving this letter that the bank contacted me by phone now telling me I owe them {$1100.00} due to late fees. According to one individual I spoke with she stated that the payments were late from the beginning. This was the first time I was notified of this. In XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the bank requesting the outstanding balance statement or information be mailed to me : I have never any received any such mail. The only mail I received from the bank was after my last letter that included the skipped payment which was also requesting my car title, along with any other documents needed to transfer the title to my name. 

Note : This bank does offer the option to "" pass a payment '. Once again I am referring to the instructions stated in the payment book. "" Valid after making 12 consecutive, timely and full loan payments. '' I did choose this option with the XX/XX/XXXX payment ; I skipped only 1 payment. That is the skipped payment I referred to above. I was never notified by the bank in a letter or by phone call that I could not do this because I was presumably late on my payments. Also according to the instructions provided in the payment book there is "" assessed '' a {$50.00} deferral fee but it does not state anything about late fees. 
It was not until I contacted the bank to request my payment history that I learned the bank was assessing {$35.00} late fees almost every month beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. Once again I was never notified by letter, phone calls or other means that I was late. 

This shows you how deceptive this bank works and how difficult it is to communicate and to get issues resolved with them. I am now at the end of my loan payment, and they are still trying to charge me additional {$1100.00} in late fees. It is important to note that this amount has since increased to over {$1700.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This amount is according to the individual that I last spoke to on the phone.

The court order also states that I would not be liable or any financial obligations or foreclosures since I awarded the house to my EX. It also states that he alone was solely responsible for the property and all financial obligations regarding the mortgage and property. Well I have been fighting this since XX/XX/XXXX I have contacted XXXX XXXX   numerous times and send in the court order on 4 different occasions. XXXX XXXX  refused to do anything. I contacted all three credit beaus and submitted complains and my court orders and still nothing. My ex starting making late payments in XX/XX/XXXX and then eventually foreclosed on the home. Since I no longer owned the home or had any rights regarding it, it was not my obligation and I was never notified regarding the foreclosure because again, it was no longer my home the court legally gave it to my ex-husband. The problem is, late mortgage payments on my credit in XX/XX/XXXX and a foreclosure of a property that I not longer had ownership of. This is FRAUD. I Have a court order stating I can not be penalized and or have any financial obligation or owner ship rights of the property. So how in the world can this be reported against me and effect me negatively when I legally no longer had rights to the property, mortgage or any business regarding the account ( per the divorce order )?

How do you put a foreclosure or late payment marks on someone who was told by a court of law that they are not to have any dealings with that property or mortgage anymore and its awarded to the other party. Again this is all court ordered, my responsibly to this property and account was terminated by the court in XX/XX/XXXX.

All you do is tell them my complaint, and they send you some pathetic response, and that's it. Nothing changes. They are pathetic, and so are you, in reality. This is not a "" consumer protection '' bureau at all. But here 's my new complaint, even though I know it won't do any good.

I have been trying for the entire time I've been dealing with this company to do a loan assumption. They have lied and wasted vast quantities of time, over and over again. None of them know what they are doing. They all lie and are completely incompetent, it is pathetic. I can't see how the company makes any money at all. It is fascinating.

So they finally claimed that they had hired an FHA approved underwriter or something. Which is probably a lie. But they told me after months of lies and stalling that they finally had the personnel available to do the loan assumption. So they sent me the forms to fill out and told me all the stuff to send it.

Right there on their own paperwork, it says that they will complete the whole loan assumption decision making progress within one month of receiving the paperwork. Do you think they did that? No, they did not. Do you think I honestly expected them to? Of course not.

I sent them everything they asked for and more. It was sent USPS Certified Mail, signature required. I have their signature and proof of them receiving the information. They can not claim they did not receive it.

But here 's where it gets interesting. They lie and fail to communicate with me, week after week and month after month. They change personnel constantly. I can never get ahold of anyone that is supposed to help me. But out of the blue, a week after they receive the paperwork, they call me. I couldn't believe it. But they called me. They now claimed that some "" 3rd party '' had been contracted to handle the loan assumption. This was news to me. The lies they previously told me were that they had to hire their own internal people. But okay, new lies. New stuff.

The guy that called me swore up and down that the third party would be calling me before that week ended. Well, they received the paperwork on XX/XX/2019. The guy called me, I think, on XX/XX/2019. Guess what? It is now XX/XX/XXXX as I'm typing this complaint. No one ever called. No one has returned my calls as I've tried to find out what is going on. No NewRez/Shellpointe person has called me. No "" 3rd party '' has called me.

Is there really a 3rd party? Or is it just another lie? Did I spend tons of money on copying and mailing to just waste my time once again? Will this pathetic company ever do anything they are supposed to do?

I'm attaching the USPS receipts, just in case these pathetic people try to claim they never received the paperwork. Of course, they gave up that game when they called me and told me that some "" 3rd party '' would be contacting me about the paperwork, anyway. But just in case, I'm attaching it.

In late XX/XX/XXXX, a second fax was sent with the same the income sensitive/based repayment plan package. On follow up phone call it was confirmed by the AESXXXX XXXX the paperwork was received and was complete. 

Through this process kept sending payments ( which AES/XXXX deemed insufficient ). The same package was sent to Fed Loan with no issue. 

By the first week of XX/XX/XXXX, on follow up phone call, AES/XXXX denied having received the second fax. The same the income sensitive/based repayment plan package was sent by USPS certified mail. During the XXXX call the borrower was blamed for the misplaced papers. 

It took 4 attempts and USPS evidence, before AES/XXXX was forced to acknowledge the receipt of the documents. On the XXXX phone call, a supervisor stated that having receipts of successful delivery of a fax and confirmation of receipt by an AES/XXXX was not enough evidence. 


Access to Information 1. AES/XXXX Agents have withheld important information on targeted payments. The concept of sequence targeted payments was not discussed only after the borrower refused to accept a forbearance. 

2. AES/XXXX Agents have failed to fully explain discrepancies on the different letters and emails that are been sent. Where different amount due are stated. 


Deceitful/Retaliatory Practices 1. During the late XXXX call, AES/XXXX   imposed a forbearance. Under duress, the borrower had to accept the terms and conditions of a forbearance. As AES/XXXX did not offer any other option and threatened with adverse actions if the forbearance was not accepted. 
By the end of XXXX, the loans were already behind payments and a new forbearance was in order. Consistently AES/XXXX try to impose forbearances and no other option is offered. 

2. After the XX/XX/XXXX phone call ( on a Friday ), when a financially beneficial arrangement to AES/XXXX was not reach, AES/XXXX  engaged in retaliatory behavior. The loans were immediately sent to collection. On the next Monday first call from a collection agency was received. 
Also, after the XXXX phone call ( on a Friday ), other loans that were reported as missing payments. This in spite that the borrower has been paying double the amount that is monthly due. 

3. AES/XXXX Agents notes on the phone calls do not fully reflect what transpire during those calls. Key elements of the phone call are omitted and are sanitized to place the blame on the borrower of any mistake. 


To finalize This mismanagement has resulted in affecting the payment capability of the borrower. AES/XXXX processes are not transparent and their processes are so convoluted that confuse the borrower. To add insult to injury, AES/XXXX refuse to recognize that the borrower has shown good faith, made payments beyond what is required by the income sensitive/based repayment plan and try to keep communication with their agents. The collection agencies contracted by AES/XXXX   have engaged in questionable business practices. 

AES/XXXX keeps showing bad faith in their dealings with the borrower causing undue financial hardship to the borrower.",None,AES/PHEAA,MD,212XX,None,Consent provided,Web,07/23/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3315474

06/04/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit repair services,Fraud or scam,None,"My name is XXXX XXXX I signed up for credit repair services with Lexington Law. According to the internet, their offices are in XXXX XXXX XXXX, Utah. 

I paid Lexington Law, approx. {$520.00} over a four-month period, in automatic monthly credit card payments of {$120.00}. Instead them cleaning up my credit, they basically file a bunch of useless challenges that they knew would fail anyway. They used these useless challenges as busy work to justify charging {$120.00} on my credit card each month. With each call from me complaining about the lack of progress, the Paralegal would promise yet another challenge. 

In the past, I have always avoided using XXXX I always thought that they were a bunch of fast-money scammers. I chose Lexington Law because they are supposed to be representatives of the law. As such, I thought they would act as a fiduciary. In previous years when I sought their help, they did act in this manner. But the new Lexington Law behave more like the internet scammers. You can read the details of my experience in the email I wrote to Lexington Law that follows : Email That I wrote to Lexington Law Service Level : Premier Plus : Client ID : XXXX XX/XX/2019 I am asking that you cancel my account immediately. I am also requesting a full refund for the following dates : XXXX XXXX {$120.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$120.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$120.00}, XX/XX/XXXX {$120.00} I am requesting these refunds because your phone reps deceived me. They said that you could clean up my credit report by filing challenges, even though your reps know that challenges only work if the record is untrue or incorrect. I told them that XXXX and XXXX were true. I told you that only the XXXX XXXX XXXX was untrue because I have never had an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I signed up in XX/XX/2019, I had 3 charge offs that I wanted removed : XXXX XXXX Visa, XXXX XXXX Card, and XXXX XXXX XXXX I told your reps that I was willing to settle with XXXX and XXXX, but I was concerned that they would just take my money and not keep their word. So, I asked your reps to call them. They said that Lexington  law does not do that. And I specifically remember asking, am I wasting my money then? I was assured by your reps that challenges were an effective tool, even when everything is true because the creditors get tire of having to defend the negative report. 

Well, I now understand that the true purpose of the endless challenges is to give the client false hope, so that the monthly subscription fees keep coming in. After 4 1/2 months and {$520.00}, only one late payment has been removed from one credit report. All 3 of the charge-offs remain. They knew they could not help me from the start, but if they had admitted it, I would not have signed the contract. 

On about XX/XX/XXXX, I called to complain that no progress had been made. The Lexington rep talked about a doing something called an Escalation Challenge. Apparently, they send a notarized letter to the creditor. They said they that the letters would arrive in the mail. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, the paperwork never arrived. So, guess it was just another ploy to keep the monthly subscription fees rolling in. 

Four years ago, Lexington Law did great credit repair work at reasonable prices. When I first heard about them, they charged about {$29.00} per month, and they did everything. They took my credit score from sub 500 to above 700. This is the reason I re-signed with them. Even though the subscription fee was now {$120.00} per month, if they could get results, it would be worth it. Now they are very different. They only offer superficial services now. And they will not call the creditor. I am still trying to figure out what changed. perhaps they are under new management. 

The new Lexington Law only seem to care about subscription fees now. And that would be ok if they called the creditor and got results, but that is not what they do. The new Lexington Law is very lazy!!! For this reason, I deserve a full refund of {$520.00}. I feel like I got scammed.",None,"John C.

After 3-4 months from the date of installation we started noticing a yellow, orange, red, and greenish color substance in our showers, toilets, and sinks. So we called the sales person over 50 times and he did not answer. Finally, we got in touch with the main office and the manager called us back. He came to the house, we showed him the problems. He took samples, and they were inconclusive. Then we called again, spoke to another manager, he came out same thing. Then they sent a tech out, the tech informed me that the reading should be under 10 because it is a new water system, when he did the test, there was no difference between the city water coming into the house and the water coming out of the system, which I saw with my own two eyes because he was showing me the reading. After he saw the readings he tried to change his story so we called the main office and spoke to the main guy in California.

Which is a lie because we have bank statements to prove it. We even told them to come get their machine and they said that it would be a good idea to come get it and yet again NOTHING was done.

05/21/19,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I charged a British Airways flight on my British Airways Visa card, issued by Chase. I am a life time Gold member of British Airways and my credit limit with Chase is {$50000.00} - I am a very good customer of both companies. The BA agent made a mistake when taking my booking and immediately issued a refund of the full amount. She then re-charged my card the exact same amount for a correct booking. There was no dispute between me and the merchant about any of these facts. 


These 3 transactions all happened within five minutes of each other. The two charges were made so close together that they had exactly the same exchange rate to 9 decimal places of accuracy - XXXX ( see attached credit card receipt ). However, when I received my "" full refund '' of the first charge it was {$47.00} less than I paid. I disputed this difference with Chase. 


For some reason the "" Customer Service Specialist '' at Chase could not comprehend these 3 simple transactions and what had happened. He wrote to me twice ( see attached ) and called me once asking the same irrelevant questions and then denied my dispute without any explanation. If this was not so frustrating and time wasting, it would be comical. 


I think this reflects a bigger problem with Chase - lack of integrity. Chase consistently backs the merchant in any dispute, no matter the merits of the case. What evidence for this?

04/20/19,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"Basically, Chase is so anti-customer, that is why I never got my money back nor the services / and products promised for the money that was scammed, all the while, Chase assisted these scammers by doing everything they can to go against me. In addition, the reps have been so rude, talking over me, twisting my words, making conversations more frustrating than they should be. 

Rather than be understanding with the customer, they've done everything the opposite. Most companies protect their customer, has their best interest at heart. Not Chase. They told me to submit certain things for my dispute to later be told it's not good enough that they won't count it as proof. Even after learning that the other party has paid a fee for a chargeback, them giving up allowing me to win this dispute so the chargeback would occur, and since that was a good thing for me, a customer of Chase, they didn't allow for it. They argued with XXXX. 

Again, I was lied to about what to provide, was lied to about how it would be resolved being told as long as the merchant doesn't respond in those billing cycles which the merchant did not and I provided proof, whereas Chase sees an automatic response from XXXX and somehow believes this is the merchant rebutting that I received my items. 

They have made no sense. Talking to the executive office has not helped. I just need for you all to open your eyes, none of your actions have been justified. Instead of going out of your way to hurt me and disprove me, why not see the proof provided and help me like most companies would do for their customers. 

And just saying "" that's not accurate '' doesn't make it true. Try listening and seeing if there's truth to what is being told to you. I wouldn't be making this up for no reason, not just for {$530.00} when you see I've spent much more than that on this credit card. 

Lastly to prove Chase is AGAINST THE CUSTOMER, ANTI-CUSTOMER, instead of Pro-customer / for the customer - FALSE ADVERTISEMENT : According to the XXXX and benefits of my credit card, you can even file dispute if you are not satisfied with your purchase. Well, not receiving the items and services I paid for does make me unsatisfied, as well as the merchant blocking my phone number. It says it all right here : https : //www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/dispute/quality So if all of this happens to me, then you rebuttal my proof, then it makes the above false advertisement. 

Avoid Chase. Unless you want a company that posts policies they will not abide by and will fight their own customers which in turn assists scammers. Years and years of complaints against Chase show this pattern of them changing the rules and screwing over their customers. 

Lastly the attachment, nobody seems to understand it was the seller 's sister 's account but that complicates things. But when I first submitted the dispute, Chase told me to send screenshots of emails or text messages, and the most recent phone call, the rudest Chase employee yet on XX/XX/XXXX, said she can not prove the phone number belongs to the merchant. I am attaching proof of this. It's not my fault this was not done prior since nobody had asked for this. It shows where I am urging them to contact federal agencies to take action against Chase since the fact this was all mis-handled by Chase has kept the money away from both seller and customer.",None,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,TX,750XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/20/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3218166

When I received my XX/XX/XXXX statement I was charged 17.24 % interest so I contacted them to ask why they said that the 1.99 % rate was only in effect for purchases after XX/XX/XXXX ( the day I signed up ). I pointed out that this was not what I was told by the agent on XX/XX/XXXX and they could see it in the prior chat conversation but said that they were sorry for the inconvenience but the prior agent had either misunderstood my question or misinformed me but there was nothing they could do about it. I asked to speak to a supervisor and she basically told me the same thing. I have a long history with this company of paying my balance in full each month so why would I have agreed to pay 17.24 % on this balance? If I needed to secure funds to pay the balance off I would have used my HELOC at a 4.5 % rate. It just does not make sense to me why they would not correct the issue.,None,AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,ME,None,Older American,Consent provided,Web,06/23/19,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3284102

08/28/19,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I received a XXXX XXXX email asking me if a purposely closed my TS Bank Credit Card. 

I immediately called TD Card Services and I was told that my account was closed because it had not been used. I explained that I purposely kept the card at XXXX balance and as an emergency credit card, once I paid off the previous balance. 

The account representative asked if I wanted her to re-open the account and I said yes. The representative said the credit card was re-opened and that I need to use it to make sure it is not closed. 

At an appointment on XX/XX/XXXX, to get my eyebrows done, I went to use the card and was humiliated because the transaction was declined. I immediately called TD Card Services and asked why my transaction was declined and I was told "" we stopped use of your card because your mailings show I moved. I explained that all correspondence was supposed to be done through email and nothing is supposed to be mailed! I also stated that I used the mobile app to update my address and I was told "" the Card Services did not get that update '' The account representative confirmed and updated my contact information for Card Services and was told I was ok to use my card. 

In XXXX I called to confirm the card I had was still having problems and showing closed in my credit history. I explained this closure drastically damaged my credit/FICO score and I am still waiting on them to correct the account being closed. 

This time I was told by the account representative that my card was never activated again in XXXX and the previous representatives were incorrect in the actions provided. I escalated this to a supervisor who then stated that they showed no calls from me asking to keep my card active and asked to re-apply to have my credit card opened again. I asked why do I need to re-apply for a card that you should never have closed. I have an active checking account and line of credit so I am not understanding why TD Bank would purposely close my good standing credit card account! They did not call me or email me knowing that I purposely checked to have nothing physically mailed to me. 

I have complained to TD Bank about their practices after realizing that they purposely marked my line of credit and my credit card with a late fee in XX/XX/XXXX. When I called to correct no late payments, I was then told that my line of credit showed me late for a payment. In reviewing the line of credit payments, it seems that even though I made multiple payments, using the mobile app, double payments did not count for XX/XX/XXXX and TD Bank would correct the late payment in my credit history. After a few months, I called back and was told that I was given incorrect information and no correction was going to be made, despite no history of previous or late payments afterwards. 

It is my belief that TD Bank is targeting and purposely destroying my credit history in an attempt to force me to use their credit card for high profit gain on interest and service fees. 

I have had a XXXX XXXX account ( before it they acquired XXXX XXXX Bank ) since XXXX with no issues. Since losing my XXXX year daughter to XXXX  in XXXX, I opened a TD Bank account to alleviate some despair of related memories.

I signed up and noted the online form would not accept my PO Box as mailing address, saying it required a street address. We have no mail delivery in this rural area.

I called XXXX and thought the account access problem was solved.

It was not.

I have repeatedly tried to sign-in and gotten messages indicating the password is incorrect. When I use the password recovery procedure with social security and XXXX  account number, it consistently returns the same message : "" Please try again later.

This is a temporary issue, so it should work again in 30 to 60 minutes. If youre still having trouble, please give us a call.

TransUnion powers XXXX XXXX XXXX, and you can contact their customer service representatives Monday through Friday, from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ET at XXXX. '' Apparently XXXX contracted with TransUnion to provide the free credit check report service.

Calling that number resulted in some of the poorest customer service experience ever received.

The first person who answered for TransUnion did not give her name on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. When repeatedly asked for her name she said spoke in an accent I could not understand. I asked her to spell her name and she hesitated. It turned out to be 'XXXX '. When I told her I was calling to recover access to XXXX XXXX XXXX, she put me on hold for 8 minutes with annoying music and no option to cancel it.

Then 'XXXX ' answered with an soft voice and accent that was difficult to understand.

She did not say what company or department she worked for.

XXXX  asked for my name, social security, DOB, Mailing Address to identify me.

When I told her about the mailing address/street address software problem with XXXX XXXX XXXX and TransUnion, she did not know what to say except that she would have to transfer me to someone else. She kept on repeating she was 'Here to help ' and I told her she was not helping, since all I wanted was my account access, not a runaround being repeatedly put on hold. She put me on hold and after 6 minutes of blaring music louder than her voice I hung up.

I seriously wonder if this is the kind of poor service XXXX and TransUnion CEOs XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX want their customers to have.

They are losing valuable relationships, goodwill and business referrals by putting customers through this ordeal without Corporate accountability.
