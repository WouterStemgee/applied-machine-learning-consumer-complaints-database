04/25/19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,FL,331XX,None,Consent provided,Web,04/25/19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,3222896

Further some credits that he found were not credited to the amount of {$6800.00}. He emailed us that this amount should be credited but this was never issued by Amex. Interest on these have been continuing for the past ten years. We have sent dozens and dozens of emails, phone calls and reminders to their executive and consumer complaint team hoping they would take ownership of their errors and accept the emails of their former employees. In the interim the account was on auto-pay and they were charging us monthly interest of over 30 %. 
The reason we couldnt stop this minimum atuo-pay is because they would report nonpayment to the credit agencies, and they would ruin Mr. XXXX credit. 
I just reached out to Amexs executive team again to request to resolve this, and they found uncredited fraud charges for {$1000.00}, however, the interest rates charged on balances were approximately 30 % and the credits issued were calculated at a nominal interest rate. Approximately {$47000.00} has been paid in interest only till date on these uncredited disputes and fraud charges which despite immense patience and several emails to Amex has not be credited. 
Attached are emails to the account representatives.

04/25/19,Debt collection,Credit card debt,Took or threatened to take negative or legal action,Threatened or suggested your credit would be damaged,"We are raising a new concern regarding debt collection practices our recent filing on the following : We originally opened an account with XXXX XXXX via their third party creditor - XXXX XXXX XXXX - who has taken advantage of us as consumers, U.S. Veterans, and XXXX XXXX Minorities. We previously reported and wrote a letter in XX/XX/XXXX that we were experiencing extenuating medical and financial circumstances, due to our daughter being hospitalized for over 34 Days in XXXX and my major job loss and made many attempts inXX/XX/XXXX with calling in to request special exceptions and special programs due to these difficult challenges we were having and my husband had already given XXXX the permission to speak with me, XXXX XXXX, ( his wife ), which is documented and taped on XXXX recording systems as well. They made no attempt to provide us with a special finance program due to the extenuating financial & medical circumstances we expressed and have be exasperated mentally and physically over the last 2 years with caring for our daughters major illness and life-threatening medical condition she encountered at the end of XX/XX/XXXX while away at school. We encountered over {$70000.00} in medical bills and had to care for our daughter. Although we made concerted efforts to notify XXXX and request a special exception/program, they showed no empathy nor sympathy concerning our situation and we were not given any notice until someone knocked on our door regarding lawsuit paperwork which were unaware. We also did not receive the proper notification that it was being turned over to a lawyer or the written prior indication that a lawsuit was imminent via a document called a Notice of Intent to Sue. Upon receiving the falsified lawsuit, I again made multiple calls to XXXX starting in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX &XX/XX/XXXX& XX/XX/XXXX, in an attempt to discuss the account, the letter they received in XX/XX/XXXX, and potential workout plans but was never given the opportunity avail. I explained that I sent letter explaining our situation in XX/XX/XXXX when our daughter was hospitalized for 34 Days Including XXXX  and never received a response on workout plan. I also spoke to Ms. XXXX, the Assigned Account Manager, in XX/XX/XXXX who stated she would escalate the request to her management team to reduce the balance and see what type of settlement offer they could provide. However, I never heard back. I made other attempts over 10 to call back in to pick up the conversation which was had in XX/XX/XXXX and was promised they would get back with me but never did and calls were recorded on their systems if they did not delete them. I also reached out to contact XXXX again in XX/XX/XXXX, & XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with another Account Manager,  XXXX, after being directed to the shark Day Law firm whom they hired and who also utilized stall tactics, claiming they reached out to XXXX regarding our multiple requests to negotiate the balance he was attempting to collect on a {$2000.00} card with costs inflated to {$4000.00}. XXXX claimed she was also going to get with her manager to request an exception to negotiate the balance and promised to circle back to me on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, since I made attempts to contact the lawyer via phone and they were screening and dodging my calls. However, I never heard back from XXXX and attempted to call back in on XXXX XXXX and received various transfers to different people which was another run around stall tactic. I also made several attempts to contact The Day Law Firm to speak with XXXX the assigned law representative the The Day Law Firm and on almost every instant between XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, she avoided my calls and would not pick up the phone. I also had to dial another extensionXXXX, to get someone else to pick up and reach XXXX so I could discuss the account and try to negotiate, after they also received an email per their instruction from my husband to grant me permission to speak on the account. Also, we were originally inquiring with a lawyer via XXXX XXXX to attempt to send a negotiation letter on the account, however, that was denied as well. We did not retain the lawyer and was subsequently told that we now needed to send a letter of release from XXXX XXXX XXXX, but we never retained them. These were also other illegal forms of stall tactics utilized by the Day Law Firm which was hired by XXXX XXXX XXXX to come after us, although we made several attempts to notify XXXX of our situation and request a Workout Plan but was denied or lied to on every count. Also, with other attempts to reach Day Law Firm via email and voicemail messages, I asked if they had reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and they claimed they were waiting to hear back. However, when I reached out to XXXX on the late afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX, she informed me that they had no indication on file or anywhere in the system that the Day Law Firm reached out to them, since we proposed negotiations on XXXX XXXX. I also left a voice mail to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  regarding their stall tactics, since I did not receive an answer from XXXX nor did I receive a return call on any of the messages I left with Day Law Firm. They were also taking advantage of us during this time because they knew an Answer had to be filed by XX/XX/XXXX or else it would Default to a Judgement which were trying to avoid. And widen I did finally get XXXX on the phone after her colleague went to her desk on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told we did not have to file an Answer by XXXX at Day Law Firm as she claimed, we are waiting to hear back from the client and most people don't file an answer and I said I wanted to be certain that they would not try to default and she said no that wont happen. However after, the call she never picked back up each time I called in and I, in turn, called XXXX again, and spoke to XXXX who claimed she did not know what filing an Answer was, although she was in the Legal department and also wanted to verify where my husband worked when I called in on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, although this had never been discussed previously. Each party, XXXX and The Day Law firm were corroborating against us and not willing to help us and attempting to take advantage of us in the process. Also the account is under {$3000.00}, however, the Day Law Firm, on purpose and with ill will intent filed the claim in State of Georgia Civil Court vs. the Magistrate XXXX County Court which oversees civil claims under $ 25K only to take advantage of XXXX Minorities in attempt to take their payroll checks in hopes of one not filing an Answer or making it difficult on the defendant. Therefore, we also believe we are being discriminated and retaliated against as U.S. Military Veterans and XXXX XXXX XXXX Minorities which I stated to Day Law Firm as well via email phone call on XX/XX/XXXX& XX/XX/XXXX due to stall tactics lack of empathy, and on purpose telling us lies between XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXXand taking advantage of us in a vulnerable state as XXXX XXXX XXXX Minorities and U. S. Military Veterans. 

We are requesting that XXXX work with us on the real balance of the account which is {$2300.00} and discuss letter and request for workout plan, prior to our account being transferred to The Day Law Firm in XXXX, GA who takes advantage of XXXX XXXX XXXX Minorities in the GA. I was informed by a XXXX the balance was {$2300.00} prior to in being transferred to Day Law Firm and had to ask for the Account details, but was not provided this information by XXXX when I called in XX/XX/XXXX, although they had access to it but was told they could not retrieve and had to go through the Day Law Firm. I kept getting the run around regarding this request as well and after requesting it repeatedly in email and phone with Day Law Firm, they did not send it until XX/XX/XXXX, the last day to file an Answer.
